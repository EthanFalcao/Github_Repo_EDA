# Mining Graph Patterns from Github Repositories 

## Overview
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools and datasets for analyzing GitHub repositories. It's part of a Graph Mining MQP (Major Qualifying Project) supervised by Professor Murai and Professor Zou. The goal is to uncover insights from GitHub repositories to understand the dynamics and characteristics of software development projects.

## Features
- **TopRepos**: Analysis scripts focused on identifying and analyzing the top GitHub repositories.
- **Data**: Cleaned and organized datasets for EDA.
- **File Structure**: Tools for understanding the organization of repositories.
- **Repo Specific**: Scripts designed for detailed analysis of specific repositories.
- **Repo Status Classification**: Machine learning models for classifying the status of GitHub repositories.

## Installation
To set up this project for local development or usage, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/EthanFalcao/Github_Repo_EDA.git

2. Install the required dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: You might need to navigate to the specific folders for certain analyses.

## Usage
Each folder in this repository serves a distinct purpose in the analysis of GitHub repositories. Navigate to the desired folder and follow the instructions provided in the individual README files (if available) for detailed guidelines on running the scripts or notebooks.

## Next Years Taks
 * Are there any patterns with any of the 'resurrected" repos?
